Luminous version r657

Installation
==============

Just extract this archive to your webserver. Keep the file-tree structure 
intact.

Point your browser at luminous/example.php to check that everything is working.
If it's not showing anything highlighted then chances are you've got some funky 
symlinking going on and Luminous couldn't figure out the necessary path to the 
CSS includes. Look at PHP source code of example.php , specifically the call
to luminous_get_html_head() to try hard coding the relative path from your
document root.

IMPORTANT: If you got the SVN version, you should have a directory called 
tests/. It is really important that this shouldn't be publicly visible on 
a webserver because the tests are:
  * Of no help whatsoever to a production machine
  * Fairly intensive and if your server is configured such that they could be
    executed via the HTTP interface then someone could use it to DoS attack
    you without much effort on their part
So don't upload it! (although a .htaccess is present, in case you do, but 
don't!)

Usage
============

Quick usage: include luminous.php and `echo luminous($language, $code)', where 
language is a valid language code, a table of these can be found by pointing 
your browser at luminous/supported.php.

For more detailed usage instructions either browse the source of example.php, 
or see the doxygen documentation (preferably the latter as it is much more 
detailed). 

If you wish to use caching, remember to create the directory 'cache', which
must be readable and writable by the server. This usually entails giving it 777
permissions. The directory should be created one level up from Luminous's 
source files, which if you have not changed any structure, is most likely the 
same directory as this README file. You can use the example.php to check if 
caching is working.
