* More extensive highlighting/recognition of certain languages (Scala, Go,
  Groovy, Ruby, Perl, etc)
* Wider language recognition. Pygments and Geshi support literally hundreds of 
  languages and common formats (e.g. configuration files), Luminous can too.
* More output formats:
  * PDF (probably via LaTeX)
  * Rich text format (RTF)
  * Terminal output via ANSI escape sequences. \033m[91 and all that.
  * Possibly other markup languages if there are any in actual use.
* A CLI interface. This should be fairly simple, just a wrapper around 
  src/luminous.php.
* The ability to build custom extensions to the parser; this might work 
  something like: the grammar defines a type as an opening delimiter and then 
  says "actually I'll handle the closing delimiter", so Luminous fires a 
  callback which then does the actual lexing for the duration of that state. 
  This would allow a much more finely grained control than currently possible. 
  There is an underlying need for that extra level of control in some places, 
  but it really needs to be assessed exactly what problem this needs to address 
  before it's implemented.
* A clearly defined plugin system. Luminous already is loosely pluginable via 
  the callbacks but it needs a stronger API.
