LUMINOUS WORDPRESS PLUGIN

Usage: 
1) place (or symlink) the luminous_wp.php or wp/luminous directory file inside 
your $WORDPRESSROOT/wp-content/plugins directory.

2) Enable the plugin from the plugins page of your wordpress admin area

3) The plugin has a configuration page which may be found under the plugins 
menu in your admin area. You will likely have to change the 'path' option
as this is where the plugin expects to find the installation of Luminous.
This is relative to your document root. So if you put wordpress in a 
directory called "/wordpress/" and luminous in a directory called 
"/luminous/", the right path is "/luminous". The options page will display a 
warning if the current saved settings are wrong.

4) To initiate syntax highlighting on your content, post it between
[sourcecode language='java'] [/sourcecode] tags. Language should be
anything recognised by the luminous simple API,
http://www.asgaard.co.uk/code/projects/docs/luminous/html/supported_languages.html

Attributes can be set in the tag as well as language; 'height' (int), 'wrap' (int) and 'escaped' (true/false). Escaped should be set to true if you have escaped the characters <, > and & to &lt;, &gt; and &amp;
Using the 'rich text' editor in Wordpress may currently break indentation
and so forth. Patches welcome.
