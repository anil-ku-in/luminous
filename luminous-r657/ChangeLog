Version 0.5.7 (04/02/11)
	New Stuff:
		* JSON language highlighting
		* example.php moved into examples/ directory, and a bunch of 
			examples for different use cases -- theme switching, 
			inline highlighting with AJAX, displaying fullpage, etc

	Fixes:
		* MATLAB language was somehow totally broken in 0.5.6. This is now fixed
			and back up to its pre 0.5.6 quality. Test cases added to make sure this 
			doesn't happen again.
		* Fix bug where legal state transitions were sometimes ignored, leading
			to the case where nested tokens were not highlighted depending on 
			how they were defined, e.g. various things in Ruby heredoc, and LOLCODE
			escape sequences.
		* Fix POSSIBLE XSS vulnerability. Exactly whether or not you were 
			exposing this depends on exactly how you were handling themes.
		* HTML strict output with links can optionally disable their 
			target=_blank attribute, this is actually non-standard and would break
			your validation on strict doctypes, see $LUMINOUS_STRICT_STANDARDS
			variable.
		* Fix some bugs with superfluous newlines in the non-line numbered HTML 
			formatter.


Version 0.5.6 (18/01/11)
	New Stuff:
		* Safe mode! Safe mode will prevent Luminous from recognising data types
			which are nested more than 10 levels deep inside other types. This is
			theoretically possible, but highly unlikely in legitimate source code.
			Preventing this prevents an attacker from crafting sources to make
			Luminous consume a lot of resources. So this is a security feature.
			If you need to disable this (and you don't) you'll have to hard code it.
		* Addition of a large testing suite. You shouldn't see this if you get
			a prepackaged version. But it makes Luminous better.

	Fixes:
		* The get_themes() function will no longer display both minified and
			non-minified CSS.
		* Fixed a bug where errors could occur due to incorrect regex escaping
		 	of dynamically created regexes
		* Hyperlinker won't link quotes, and will always work with www\d and https
			links (these were sometimes lost due to an overzealous optimisation)
		* Unconstrained output is now truly unconstrained, you won't have to 
			scroll to the bottom of the page to see the h-scrollbar anymore.	
		* Luminous now tends not to highlight empty segments of string. This 
			slightly reduces memory usage and output size.
		* Rules involving recursive regular expressions have been rewritten to 
			make use of Luminous's stateful model because it seems easy to make
			recursive PCRE regexes crash PCRE. This wouldn't have brought down your
			server directly as Apache spawns worker threads (and only the thread
			would segfault), but it still seems like a security issue.
		* Case insensitive languages' performance is greatly increased. The
			runtime for evaluating a CI string should scale linearly with the 
			length of the string, now, like case sensitive languages (it was 
			possibly exponential before due to an oversight).

	A lot of language improvements, including:
		* Ruby is a lot more resiliant. Ruby is a langauge in which it's easy to
			fool a syntax highlighter. It's now a little harder to fool Luminous.
		* C/C++ preprocessor statements may be indented. Also, comments inside
		  preprocessor statements should always be detected.
		* SQL recognises some MySQL extensions including # comments and \' string
			escaping in single quoted strings
		* PHP recognises classnames after 'extends'
		* BNF won't split HTML entities anymore
		* Bash heredoc is better
		* Erlang buggy regex fixed
		* Perl regex detection is a little better.
		* '\\' is now a recognised escape sequence inside strings, and so are 
			\xyz octal sequences
		* Python comment vs string is now harder to fool
		* JavaScript recognises 'jQuery' as a function.
		* Other minor stuff.

Version 0.5.5 (29/12/10)
	Fixes:
		* Fix broken line-by-line tagging in some circumstances
		* Fix accidental introduction of leading spaces on some lines due to 
			broken Javascript
		* Dummy states in language definitions no longer consume the source string.
		* Fix bug in BNF definition causing a possible non-terminating state 
		* Ruby now detects regexes if they occur after 'gsub' (without  brackets).
	  * Python can (usually?) tell the difference between a triple quoted string
			and comment.
		* Line numbering works again on the print stylesheet
		* Obsolete colour tweaks removed from the print stylesheet
		* A few minor JavaScript bugs fixed

	 New Stuff:
	 	* Some languages (python, php, perl, javascript, ruby) now highlight 
			class/function definition names but so far only in their definition 
		* Minified CSS and JavaScript. This is used automatically by the
			luminous_get_html_head function. Currently themes are not compressed
			to allow the user to tweak them easily.


Version 0.5.4 (19/12/10)
	Fixes:
		* CSS font declaration is re-ordered such that a local copy should be 
			used by the browser if 1) it's available, and 2) the browser is 
			sensible
		* .htaccess file added (in client/font/) to fix MIME type in transfer of fonts
		* Fix occasional bug causing skewed line numbering
		* Fix occasionally wrong detection of escape sequences in SQL style single
			quoted strings

	New Stuff:
		* LaTeX output formatter, with basic access to CSS themes
		* New theme - soft.css 

	Backwards incompatability:
		* css class 'td.line_numbers' changed to '.line_number_bar'
		* $_LUMINOUS_ROOT variable replaced with luminous_root() function (for
			security)

	
Version 0.5.1 (12/12/10)
	Fixes:
		* Important fix on the stateful parser thinking, e.g., a quote is both the
			start and end of the same string
		* stateful parser will not play nicely with previously matched strings 
			(i.e. PHP inside CSS won't inherit the CSS's style)
		* HTML validation fixed again
		* JavaScript 'binding' process now works on a per-widget basis, so the
			process can be invoked at the user's will (this is useful if they are
			using AJAX to repopulate different parts of the page, and need to 
			get a new widget to bind itself)
		* JavaScript font resize is now agnostic to the CSS units used.
		* light stylesheet less ugly on the object/property colouring
		* minor improvements to JavaScript, Python and Ruby rules

Version 0.5.0 (07/12/10)
	Improvements:
		* Luminous now has a stateful mode which gives it A LOT more power in 
			parsing various languages. BNF, CSS and C/C++ are now using the stateful
			mode. The latter mostly for testing, but the former two have much higher
			quality language recognition as a result. This is a Very Big Thing.
		* CSS output has a few minor fixes
		* JavaScript luminous_init() now has a 'force' argument so you can force
			everything to rebind in the event that you're using AJAX or something to
			change the Luminous objects on the page.
		* HTML Linker now works again (I seem to break/fix it every alternate 
			release)
		* Highlighting level is no longer lost on nested languages

	New Stuff:
	  * 'paradise' theme
		* Erlang language
		* LOLCODE language (yes, really)
		* Scala language
		* Support for contextual diff format (under standard diff -- note unified
			diff has also been merged into standard diff)
		* luminous_get_html_head() function in the EasyAPI, this probably handles
			your <head> tag output for you (see docs)



Version 0.4.0 (23/11/10)
	Improvements:
		* much neater file-tree. huzzah. There is a dummy luminous.php in root 
			which you	can include which gives you everything you need, for 
			simplicity. example.php is also included in root.
		* Grammars are now stored in separate files, which makes things a lot
			neater. Adding new grammars requires that you tell Luminous what file it
			exists in, or have it already included yourself. A dependency system for
			derivative grammars (e.g make inherits from bash, c++ inherits from c) 
			is included also.
		* PHP short tags (<? ?>) replaced with <?php ?>, for better compatability.

		Visual tweaks:
			* line-height is expanded a little, which tends to look a lot better
			* every 5th line number is bold
			* workaround a chrome bug to do with scrolling
			* Improve expand/collapse behaviour with respect to scrolling

	New stuff:
		* Zenophilia theme (heavily based on zenburn)
		* 'Generic' grammar -- might provide some highlighting for unrecognised
			languages. Might not, too.
		* Go grammar
		* Groovy Grammar
		* Vim-script grammar

	Core fixes:
		* better handling of large inputs; PCRE doesn't like long strings and
	 		non-greedy operators (as it triggers the dreaded backtrack limit), so
	 		Luminous internally now uses simple string methods where reasonably
			possible.
		* Fix horrible bug where a match containing other matches could in 
		  occasional circumstances cause all sorts of chaos
		* various minor fixes
	

	Language/Grammar fixes:
		* perl recognises pod/cut
		* ruby does backticks
		* A number of bugs related to regex literal recognition
		* much better numeric literal recognition in C, C#, Java, Python
		* Better doxygen-esque comment parsing
		* various optimisations in grammar callback functions
		* Various minor additions to some languages



version 0.3.1 (10/11/2010)
  New Features:
		* Luminous comes with the Bitstream Vera Mono font (similar if not
		identical to DejaVu Sans mono), which is used as the default in CSS3
		compliant browsers and IE; this is because some platforms (i.e. Windows)
		have a fairly poor selection of attractive monospace fonts installed by
		default

  Fixes:
		* URI linker should choke on fewer inputs (if any)
		* Much stronger language coverage of: ActionScript, C++, C#, MATLAB, Pascal and	Ruby
		* Various minor additions to other languages

version 0.30 (20/10/2010)
	New Features:
	* EasyAPI additions - 
		$LUMINOUS_WAS_CACHED -- logs whether the last request was cached or
		generated
		$LUMINOUS_LINK_URIS -- sets whether or not to link URLs
		$LUMINOUS_WIDGET_HEIGHT -- optionally constraint output widget to a
		maximum height (the rest will be scrolled)
		$LUMINOUS_VERSION -- self explanatory
		$LUMINOUS_PERFORMANCE_LOG -- a log of performance related data (see docs)
		$LUMINOUS_ESCAPE_INPUT -- Allows you to use HTML-escaped input and
		Luminous won't re-escape it.	
	* New Grammars - 
		BNF and EBNF ((Extended)? Backus Naur Form)
	* URLs may be converted to hyperlinks
	* Optional JavaScript additions (requires jQuery, included), containing
	things like - collapse/expand widget, print, font size++/-- search, etc
	* HTML widget may now be self-constrained to a particular height, doesn't
	need to be wrapped
	* Basic working Wordpress plugin
	* OO/Namespace syntax highlighting 	
	* Alternate line colouring
	* Clickable lines (clicking line number adds highlight with JavaScript
	enabled)
	* Various minor presentational tweaks

	Fixes:		
		* Much stronger caching behaviour in the EasyAPI -- cache hits depend on 		settings, version, grammar, etc, not just the input string.
		* Neater HTML markup and CSS

		Grammars:
		* Various PHP additions and fixes
		* Ruby heredoc slightly more robust
		* Python grammar recognises most global functions
		* Grammar callbacks now allowed to be OO class methods
		* Better PCRE recognition
		* Various minor fixes

	Misc:
		* LuminousGrammar::SetRuleset method added to allow grammars to alter their
		rulesets based on the source


version 0.25 (09/09/2010)
  New Features:
  * 'Verbosity' control -- classification system for saying what language
  elements Luminous should match (see docs), this gives configurable balance
  between prettiness and performance
  * Slightly noticable performance increase in formatting code (although
  this is lost if you run Luminous with all new features enabled)
  * EasyAPI new functions -- luminous_file() and info function
  luminous_supported_languages()
  * EasyAPI new setting variables - 
          $LUMINOUS_WRAP_WIDTH -- word wrapping at col (int)
          $LUMINOUS_LINE_NUMBERS -- Line numbering (bool)
          $LUMINOUS_HIGHLIGHTING_LEVEL -- Configurable highlighting level
  * Heredoc-like syntax support for grammars
  * Support for new languages - 
          Generic ChangeLog and Whitespace
  * Comment highlighting of TODO, FIXME, etc
  * PCRE style syntax regular expression highlighting
  * 'Dark' CSS stylesheet theme


  Fixes:
    Grammars:
    * Heredoc support implemented by Bash, Perl, PHP and Ruby
    * PCRE highlighting implemeneted by all languages whch have a regex literal type, and in PHP
    * String interpolation and variable recognition improvements in Bash,
    Perl, Ruby, PHP...
    * PHP grammar's end tag (?>) is now optional
    * C# and Java grammars recognise a number of common data struct classes as data types
    * Plain grammar recognises the generic config line format "option=value"
    * Numerous small corrections and improvements to many languages

    Other:
    * Word wrapping now fully reliable with breakpoints favouring whitespace
    * Tab/space now visible to Luminous core, conversion handled by HTML formatter.
    * Fix line number drifting by specifying a list of 'safe' fonts
    * Fix line number float drop on Opera/IE6 by changing to a two-cell table
    (line nos one cell, code the other)
    * Fix (sort of) the css LANG_* class so that it works better for nested
    languages, although it's still not advisable to rely on it for nested
    languages
    * Fix (workaround) Chrome and IE8 whitespacing bugs
    * Better recovery from unavoidable PCRE errors, like the dreaded
    backtracking limit (such errors will not erase the whole output)
    * lots and lots of testing on a whole bunch of OSS projects, and plenty of minor fixes as a result.


  Misc:
  * Formatting code moved away from core into its own class hierarchy, which
  makes it easier to add more formatters in future
  * CSS factored into a common structure stylesheet (layout) and an additional
  'theming' (colouring) stylesheet.
  * Rule LUMINOUS_DYNAMIC_DELIMS can be used to match variable length
  alphanumeric delimiters (i.e. those used in heredoc)



version 0.20 (21/08/2010):

  * Initial public release
