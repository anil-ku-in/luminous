==Quick Usage==

  # Extract your archive to some directory (or clone the repo, or whatever). This should be inside your document root, as the style/ directory needs to be web-visible. 
  # If you downloaded a development version from GitHub (as opposed to an archive from this site), remove the tests/ directory, this is not something you want to expose on a public machine. 
  # Create a directory called 'cache' and make sure it is writable to your server (this probably involves 777 permissions).
  # Now test everything is working by running the hello world of highlighting: 

{{{lang=php
<?php 
require_once '/path/to/luminous/luminous.php';
echo luminous::head_html(); // outputs CSS includes, intended to go in <head>
echo luminous::highlight('c', 'printf("hello world\n");');
}}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Directory Structure ===

Some people seem to want to deploy their setup strangely, which might make things unnecessarily complicated. Naturally, Luminous is free and open source and you can do whatever you like with it, but unless you have a good reason not to, you should leave Luminous in its subdirectory and not change or add to the subdirectory's contents (it's a library, not a framework). Let's say you want to highlight some code from your index.php, an example directory structure would be this:

{{{lang=plain
htdocs/
  index.php    -- include( dirname(__FILE__) . '/luminous/luminous.php') here
  luminous/    -- don't edit the contents of this
    cache/     -- except to create this
    ...
}}}

=== Examples ===

If you have problems, point your browser at examples/example.php and see if it works. This particular example allows you to toggle caching and will spew errors at you if there is a permissions problem with your cache.

=== Plain/non-highlighted output ===

If the output you are seeing is semi-reasonable, but it doesn't seem to actually be highlighted, the stylesheets have probably not been included.

`luminous::head_html()` tries to guess the public URL to the style directory and may (and will) get it wrong in some circumstances (specifically those involving symbolic links). You can verify that this is the problem by looking at the source: there should be two &lt;link&gt; elements whose href attributes point to your style/ directory.

If the href URL is indeed wrong, then you can either include the CSS files by hand in your PHP file and omit the call to head_html(), or you can override the 'relative-root' setting: `luminous::set('relative-root', 'real/url/to/luminous/')`

=== still doesn't work... ===

== Local API Docs==

The packaged distros come with Doxygen API documentation in the docs/html/ directory. 

These docs come in several sections:
  * `USER` - this covers the user API, and is generally useful.
  * `CORE` - this covers the base scanning classes and utilities. 
  * `ALL` - this covers the cache, the scanner lookup table, formatters, etc. These are unlikely to be useful to you.

By default USER and CORE are generated. This can be altered with the 'ENABLED_SECTIONS' setting in the Doxyfile in the root directory.
